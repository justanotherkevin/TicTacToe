I recently was request to make an unbeatable game of tic tac toe. It was a fun and very humbling project that taught me a ton. If you want to give it a shot, just follow the instruction below.  
  
In order to make the game unbeatable, it was necessary to create an algorithm that could calculate all the possible moves available for the computer player and use some metric to determine the best possible move. After extensive research it became clear that the simplest way was to impoment the Minimax algorithm.  
  
I struggled for a while few days trying to understand the fundamental of the algorithm, its limitation and scopes. I come across many codes and videos, but it was until I finally finished and began to explain the codes to my friends that I truly understood each line.  
  
I hope that by see the source code for this game, it will shine some insight to the min-max algorithm for you.
